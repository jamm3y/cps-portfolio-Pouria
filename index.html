    <h1>Welcome to My Computer Science Website</h1>

    <p>
        Hello and welcome to my wonderfully crafted website.
        This website will include projects ive worked on in AP computer Science class
        and what I learned from them in page 1.
        And in page 2, there is a playable java port of something I coded in python.
    </p>

    <p>
        This website is about what I learned in my computer science class.
        I will add topics, explanations, and examples here.
